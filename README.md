## Problem Statement
	Development of a waste management app, integrated in a smart network that
includes containers equipped with sensors that provide an updated status
on the capacity of the container (how much trash can it still take). The
containers are mapped. This feature allows users to not only know where
the nearest trash container is, but also if it can take more trash or not.
	Additionally, this app introduces a brand new service, trash pick up directly
at home. This service is done by normal citizens who want to have an extra
source of revenue. Thus, to provide this service the app needs to have both
an interface for the regular users who want to have their trash collected and
for users who wish to collect that trash and take it to the nearest recycling
facility. In order to make this service as efficient as possible, the app provides
an optimized route for the trash collectors hence reducing travel costs as well
as the time spent on the road.
